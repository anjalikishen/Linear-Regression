# Linear-Regression
An illustration for predicting Health Insurance claims.

The company wants to know the expected amount of medical bills a customer is likely to claim in the next one year 
 
The company believes claim of the insured is influenced by the “age of the insured” 
 
 ## Key concepts in Regression Analysis 
 Regression Analysis is a statistical tool for investigation of the causal effect of one or more variables upon another variable (or upon other variables) 
 
 Variables that are assumed to be the cause are known as “predictor” variables 
 
 Variables that are assumed to be the effect are known as “response” variables or “target” variables 
 
 The identified relationship is known as the “Regression Equation” 
 
 We refer to these situations as: “The target is regressed by the predictors” 
 
 
## Regression Analysis 
 It is a Process flow  Identify the variable we wish to predict, i.e., identify the target variable 
 
 * Identify the variables are likely to affect the target variable, i.e., identify the predictor variable(s) 
 
 * Collect historical data on both the predictor(s) as well as the target 
 
 * Decide on the type of relationship between the predictors and the target, i.e., decide whether the relationship is linear, exponential, logistic, etc 
 
 * Arrive at the mathematical equation to predict the target variable, i.e., estimate the regression equation 
 
 * Evaluate the efficiency of the estimated regression equation
